## Design Choices

### Typography:

No custom fonts were imported for the quiz as it did not appear necessary. The site utilizes default fonts, which were deemed sufficient for the design.

## Features:

The quiz website consists of a homepage with a brief introduction and a start button to initiate the quiz. The main quiz section includes 15 multiple-choice questions, each displaying a question and four possible answers. The game provides immediate feedback by highlighting correct answers in green and incorrect ones in red. At the end of the quiz, the user receives a summary of correct and incorrect answers, along with a congratulatory message. If the user answers incorrectly three times, the quiz ends, and they have the option to retry or return to the homepage. The site also features a mute button for audio control and includes a replay option.

To fork a repository:

1. Log in to GitHub and navigate to the repository you want to fork.
2. Click the Fork button in the top-right corner of the page.
3. Select a name for your forked repository.
4. Click the Fork button to create the copy.

Once you have forked a repository, you can clone it to your local computer and start making changes. When you are ready to share your changes, you can create a pull request to the original repository.

Once you have copied the URL, you can use a Git client to clone the repository to your local computer.
Here are the steps to clone a repository using Git Bash:

3. Open Git Bash.
4. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
5. Type the following command and press Enter:

git clone <URL>

Replace <URL> with the URL of the repository that you copied in step 2.

This will create a local clone of the repository in the current directory.

You also can create and name the directory where the clone should be saved in, with adding the directory name after the <URL>. So the full command would look like this: git clone <URl> XXXX(This is a directory name)
